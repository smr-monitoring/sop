### App download:

1. Download HOBOconnect to a phone or tablet from the App Store® or Google Play™. Download the app to a Windows computer from [HOBOconnect for windows](www.onsetcomp.com/products/software/hoboconnect).

2. Open the app and enable Bluetooth in the device settings if prompted.

3. Wake up the logger by pushing the switch on the mounting end of the logger into the gap beneath the mounting lanyard. 

4. Tap Devices and then tap the logger tile in the app to connect to the logger. 


### Calibration:

**You will need:**
Deionized or distilled water and a squirt bottle to rinse the pH sensor. • The logger with the pH electrode installed and the copper guard removed. • Calibration solution (also called buffer solution) poured into beakers. All three buffers are available in a kit (MX2500-CAL-KIT) or individually (MX2500-CAL-4, MX2500-CAL-7, or MX2500-CAL-10)

1. If the sensor is in the storage solution, unscrew the clear storage cap and remove it from the logger.  

2. Once removed, screw the closure cap onto the logger.

3. In the HOBOconnect app, tap Devices.

4. Remove the logger from water. If the logger was previously configured with Bluetooth Always Off, press the switch on the logger to wake it up. 

5. Tap the logger in the app to connect to it. 

6. Tap Calibrate if you are not automatically prompted to calibrate the logger. 

7. Use a squirt bottle to rinse the pH sensor with deionized or distilled water. 

8. Place the sensor end of the logger in the pH 7 solution and tap Start. Make sure the sensor end cap, temperature sensor, and closure cap are submerged in the solution as shown in the illustration. Once the pH reading is stable, tap Confirm. 

9. Rinse the pH sensor with deionized or distilled water. 

10. If you are using the pH 4 buffer, place the sensor end in the pH 4 solution and tap Start. If you are not using the pH 4 buffer, tap Skip and go to step 12. 

11. Once the pH reading is stable, tap Confirm. Rinse the pH sensor with deionized or distilled water. 

12. If you are using the 10 buffer, place the sensor end in the pH 10 solution and then tap Start. Once the pH reading is stable, tap Confirm. If you are not using the pH 10 buffer, tap Skip. 

13. Verify that the slope and offset are acceptable and tap Save. If the slope and offset are not acceptable, tap the back arrow and repeat the calibration steps in this section as needed. 
14. Rinse the pH sensor with deionized or distilled water again. 

- **NOTE: If you are not deploying the logger immediately, place the pH electrode in storage-solution. Unscrew the sensor end cap installed on the sensor end of the logger. If the clear storage cap is empty, pour in storage-solution to the marked fill line. Carefully screw the clear cap with storage-solution onto the logger. Only use storage-solution in the clear cap; do not use water. Do not use the copper guard when the pH electrode is in storage solution**

### Setup and deployment

**Setup:**

- get the pH logger and press in the gray button on the top while the HOBOconnect app is open on your phone 

- you should see the logger pop up on the app from its home screen

- select the logger and press the “Start Logging” button 

**Deployment:**

**Warning: Work quickly once the cap is removed because the sensor cannot become dry.**

- once at site remove the cap covering the sensor

- make sure the sensor does not become disconnected from the main body of the logger, some of them are loose.

- secure the closure cap onto where the storage lid was previously and then deploy the logger.

### Data Retrieval 
**Note: during this process the more loggers you add to your device the slower and choppier the app will run, this is alright, but make sure that you are patient with the app.**

- During retrieval, make sure that the storage cap is returned to the logger as quickly as possible. At this stage it is okay to use water found at the site as the storage liquid, but it must be switched out to the proper solution eventually.

- once the logger is collected, launch the app from your device and then hit the gray button at the top of the logger, it should show up on the HOBOconnect app.

- Select the logger and stop it from logging, there should be a pause button at the bottom of the screen.

- then select the “download data button from the selected logger.

- once the data is downloaded, go to the “Data” section of the app

- Select “export and share” at the top of the screen, find the data you downloaded and export it as a CSV file.

- Once exported the app will pop up with a bulk export summary where you can share the exported data.

- From there you can move it straight into the Google drive. 

- Once all relevant data is collected and moved into the Google drive, rename the files according to MM-DD-YY_[Site Location]_[Site salinity (FW or BR)]_PH_[Logger Letter], once this is completed you can delete the files off of your device. 

**Note: for this step the name of the files corresponds to the serial number on the logger itself, so make sure you are correctly naming the file to the correct logger.**

- If you haven't already, replace water in the storage lid with the proper storage solution and clean the sensor. Make sure to keep the sensor damp at all times.

- store safely
